# Full Game Time Calculator

## About

Tool for adding up level completion times for full game runs, ** HITMAN speedrun community**.

NOTE: This is a modified version of [the original Time Calculator](http://www.grun1.com/utils/timeCalc.html) by Gordon Smith

### Improvements So Far over Grun1's Original Site

- Github Pages seems to be a more reliable website hosting service, leading to greater site stability.
- Can now save URL with one click (on both Desktop and Mobile browsers).
- Improved font size and readability
- Removed extraneous timing options that Hitman Speedrun community doesn't use
- Split code that was originally all on one HTML file into HTML, Javascript, CSS files to make the site easier to maintain.
- Added Shortened URL's with the help of [Cors Anywhere by Rob--w](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) (made my own fork and deployed on Railway), and [this Codepen from Ephellon](https://codepen.io/Ephellon/pen/EvvGGp) that uses tinyurl API.

### Technologies Used

- Lightweight site built with vanilla Javascript, HTML, CSS.
- Deployed on Github Pages
